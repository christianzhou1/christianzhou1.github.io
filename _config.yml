          Full-stack project inspired by production backend systems maintained during my co-op term.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Designed and developed a full-stack task management system modeled after an enterprise-grade Spring Boot architecture.

          Implemented RESTful APIs, JWT authentication, file attachments via AWS S3, and OpenAPI-generated TypeScript clients for typed frontend integration.

          Containerized and deployed backend, frontend, and database services using Docker Compose on a DigitalOcean VPS with Nginx reverse proxy, HTTPS (Certbot), and automated deployment scripts (Bash/PowerShell).

          Focused on production-aligned design principles, service-layer separation, scalable schema design, and maintainable CI/CD-style workflows.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
